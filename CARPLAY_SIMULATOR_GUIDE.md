## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### CarPlay Window Doesn't Appear

**Issue**: Menu shows "CarPlay (Car)" but nothing happens

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're running iOS 14.0+ simulator
2. Try command line: `xcrun simctl ui booted CarPlay`
3. Restart Xcode and simulator

### App Doesn't Show in CarPlay

**Issue**: App runs in simulator but not in CarPlay window

**Possible Causes**:
1. CarPlay capability not enabled in Xcode
2. Build target doesn't include CarPlay
3. App needs to be built for physical device

**Solution**:
1. Check "Signing & Capabilities" in Xcode
2. Enable "CarPlay (Communication)"
3. Rebuild the app
4. Test again

### CarPlay Crashes

**Issue**: CarPlay window launches but crashes immediately

**Solution**:
1. Check Xcode console for errors
