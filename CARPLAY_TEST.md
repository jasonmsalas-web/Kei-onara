## üß™ How to Test CarPlay

### Option 1: Physical Car with CarPlay
1. Connect your iPhone to your car's CarPlay system
2. Launch the Kei-onara! app on your iPhone
3. CarPlay interface should appear in your car's display
4. Navigate through the menu items:
   - **Log Fuel** - Quick fuel entry
   - **Maintenance** - Log maintenance tasks
   - **Update Odometer** - Update current mileage
   - **Quick Stats** - View fuel efficiency stats
   - **GPS Speedometer** - Real-time speed display

### Option 2: CarPlay Simulator (Xcode)
1. Open Xcode
2. Run the app with CarPlay simulator:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl ui booted CarPlay --state Disconnect
   ```
3. Connect CarPlay in simulator
4. Test all templates and interactions

### Option 3: Simulate with Mac (if supported)
1. Connect iPhone to Mac via USB
2. Open QuickTime Player
3. File ‚Üí New Movie Recording
4. Select your iPhone as the source
5. Launch the app and test CarPlay features

## üìã Test Checklist

   ```bash
   open "Kei-onara!.xcodeproj"
   ```

2. **Set up signing**:
   - Select your Apple Developer account
   - Enable "CarPlay" capability in the project settings

3. **Build and run**:
   - Select a physical device (CarPlay doesn't work on simulator well)
   - Run the app (‚åò+R)

4. **Test in vehicle**:
   - Connect to CarPlay-enabled vehicle
