# Fix: Why CarPlay App Is Not Showing

## üîç The Problem

CarPlay apps require specific configuration that's often missing:

1. **Info.plist must declare the CarPlay scene**
2. **CarPlay capability must be enabled in Apple Developer Portal**
3. **App must be built with Development or Ad-Hoc provisioning**
4. **App must be approved for CarPlay** (for production, requires Apple approval)

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Add CarPlay Scene to Info.plist

The app needs to register its CarPlay scene in the Info.plist. Modern Xcode projects store this in the project.pbxproj file. We need to add:

```xml
<key>UISceneConfiguration</key>
<dict>
    <key>CPTemplateApplicationSceneSessionRoleApplication</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>UISceneConfigurationName</key>
            <string>CarPlay</string>
            <key>UISceneDelegateClassName</key>
            <string>CarPlaySceneDelegate</string>
        </dict>
    </array>
</dict>
```

### Step 2: Enable CarPlay in Xcode

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the project target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Click "+ Capability"
5. Add "CarPlay (Communication)"
   - OR "CarPlay (Audio App)" if your app is audio-based
6. Xcode will automatically configure the entitlements

### Step 3: Verify Entitlements File

Your entitlements file should include:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.carplay-communications</key>
<array>
    <string>carmessages</string>
</array>
```

### Step 4: Apple Developer Portal Configuration

1. Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
3. Select your App ID
4. Enable "CarPlay (Communication)" capability
5. Save changes

### Step 5: Build Requirements

CarPlay apps have special requirements:
- ‚ùå **Won't work on iOS Simulator** (needs physical device)
- ‚úÖ **Physical iPhone required**
- ‚úÖ **CarPlay-enabled vehicle OR CarPlay simulator**
- ‚úÖ **Development or Ad-Hoc build** (not App Store until approved)

### Step 6: Enable CarPlay App in iPhone Settings

1. On your iPhone: Settings ‚Üí Screen Time ‚Üí Content & Privacy Restrictions
2. Allow CarPlay apps to be installed
3. Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí CarPlay ‚Üí Your Vehicle
4. Look for "Custom App Shortcuts"
5. Enable your app if it appears

### Step 7: Testing Options

#### Option A: Physical Car with CarPlay
1. Connect iPhone to car's USB port
2. Unlock your iPhone
3. Approve the connection prompt
4. Launch Kei-onara! from CarPlay screen

#### Option B: CarPlay Simulator (Xcode 12+)
1. Open Xcode
2. Window ‚Üí External Displays ‚Üí CarPlay
3. OR use terminal:
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl ui booted CarPlay
   ```

#### Option C: Quick Time + CarPlay (Limited)
1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. QuickTime ‚Üí New Movie Recording
3. Select iPhone as source
4. Not full CarPlay experience

## üö® Important Notes

### CarPlay App Approval Process

For **production apps**, Apple requires:
1. CarPlay capability request via developer support
2. Technical review of CarPlay implementation
3. Compliance with CarPlay HIG
4. Approval before App Store release

For **development/testing**:
- Works with Development builds on your device
- Use TestFlight for beta testing
- Ad-hoc distribution works

### Why It's Not Appearing

Common reasons:
1. ‚ùå CarPlay capability not enabled in Developer Portal
2. ‚ùå Using iOS Simulator (CarPlay requires physical device)
3. ‚ùå Info.plist scene configuration missing
4. ‚ùå Build provisioning doesn't include CarPlay
5. ‚ùå App not whitelisted in CarPlay settings

## üîß Quick Fix Script

Run this in Xcode console to debug:

```swift
// In Xcode console while debugging:
po UIApplication.shared.supportsCarPlay
// Should return true

po CPInterfaceController()
// Check if CarPlay classes are available
```

## üìù Current Status

‚úÖ Code is ready:
- CarPlayManager.swift ‚úì
- CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift ‚úì
- AppDelegate.swift ‚úì
- Entitlements configured ‚úì

‚ö†Ô∏è Needs configuration:
- Info.plist scene registration
- CarPlay capability in Apple Developer Portal
- Physical device build
- CarPlay HIG compliance review (for production)

## üéØ Quick Test

To immediately test if your build supports CarPlay:

1. Build and run on your iPhone
2. Connect to CarPlay
3. Check Settings ‚Üí CarPlay ‚Üí Your Vehicle
4. Look for "Custom Apps" section
5. Your app should appear there

If it doesn't appear, the issue is likely in Apple Developer Portal configuration.
