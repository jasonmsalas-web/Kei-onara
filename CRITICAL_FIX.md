# CRITICAL: Why Kei-onara! Still Doesn't Appear

## What I See in Your CarPlay Screenshot:
- Messages ✅
- Now Playing ✅  
- Calendar ✅
- Settings ✅
- **Kei-onara! ❌ MISSING**

## The Real Problem:

Your app needs to be REGISTERED with Apple for CarPlay to work.

## EXACT STEPS TO FIX:

1. **Go to:** https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
2. **Find:** "CarmaLog.Kei-onara-"
3. **Click:** Edit
4. **Scroll:** Down to Capabilities
5. **Enable:** CarPlay → Communication
6. **Click:** Save
7. **Wait:** 10 minutes
8. **Rebuild:** In Xcode

Without step 1-7, the app will NEVER appear in CarPlay, no matter what code changes we make.

The entitlements file alone is NOT ENOUGH. Apple must approve the App ID for CarPlay capability.
