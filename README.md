- **Manual Increment**: Run `./increment_version.sh` to manually increment the version

#### Cursor Auto-Increment
```bash
# Run automatically when changes are accepted in Cursor
./cursor_auto_increment.sh

# Or manually run the auto increment
./auto_increment_version.sh
```

#### Version Information
```bash
# Show current version information
./update_version.sh show

# Manually increment version
./update_version.sh increment
```

#### Version Format
- **Marketing Version**: `1.0.XXX` (e.g., 1.0.127, 1.0.128, 1.0.130)
- **Build Number**: Increments with each version change
- **Version Name**: Each version has a codename (e.g., "Freeway")

### Version History
